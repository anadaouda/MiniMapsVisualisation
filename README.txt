1. Open command line in the Server directory
2. "npm install" (you can skip this step when you have done it once)
3. "npm start" (Make sure that you see "Waiting for requests...")
5. You can now use MiniMaps by clicking on the "MiniMaps" shortcut or Interface/realease/Interface.exe

Static mode will display an already calculated path between Art et metier and Meriadeck
Non-static (dynamic mode) will let you choose between to point and will calculate an itinerary (this mode will be much longer)
